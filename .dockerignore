# Deployment Optimization - Exclude unnecessary files to reduce bundle size
# This reduces deployment time and bundle size significantly

# Development files and directories
.git
.github
.vscode
.idea
*.log
logs/
*.tmp
*.swp

# Documentation and tests (not needed in production)
docs/
tests/
*.test.ts
*.test.js
*.spec.ts
*.spec.js
__tests__/
coverage/

# Build artifacts and caches
.turbo/
.next/
.expo/
.metro-cache/
dist/
build/
*.tsbuildinfo

# Development tools and scripts (keep scripts/ since prod-start.sh may need it)
tools/
backups/

# Mobile app (not needed for backend deployment)
apps/aiponge/

# Note: Do not exclude microservice directories here.
# The parametric Dockerfile.service builds any service from the monorepo root context.
# Excluding services would break CI/CD Docker builds.

# Environment and config files (use Replit Secrets instead)
.env.local
.env.*.local

# User uploads and data (should be in persistent storage, not deployment bundle)
uploads/
*.db
*.sqlite

# Package manager files
.npmrc
.yarnrc
yarn.lock
pnpm-lock.yaml

# OS files

# Large media files
